nextPYP: a scalable platform for cryo-EM/ET image analysis
----------------------------------------------------------

`nextPYP <https://nextpyp.app/>`_ is a platform for single-particle cryo-EM/ET image analysis developed and maintained by the `Bartesaghi Lab <http://cryoem.cs.duke.edu>`_.

By combining established tools in the field with `methods <https://cryoem.cs.duke.edu/research/methods/>`_ developed in-house, ``nextPYP`` produces state-of-the-art results while being easy-to-use, portable, and scalable to datasets with thousands of micrographs or tomograms.

Main features
-------------
- **Ease-of-use**: user-friendly, fully-featured web-based GUI with an intuitive block-based interface
- **All-in-one**: convert raw cryo-EM/ET data into high-resolution structures using a single application
- **State-of-the-art results**: advanced refinement and classification methods achieve higher-resolution
- **Particle picking suites**: cellular content mining and accurate particle localization in 2D and 3D
- **Scalability**: small storage footprint and distributed computing allows analysis of large datasets
- **On-the-fly processing**: real-time analysis of micrographs and tilt-series during data acquisition
- **Portability**: use of containers to ensure reproducibility, simplify installation and administration
- **Interoperability**: import/export metadata in multiple formats to interface with external programs

See the :doc:`Changelog<changelog>` for the **latest features**.
