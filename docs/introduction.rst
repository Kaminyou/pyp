nextPYP: a scalable platform for cryo-EM/ET image analysis
----------------------------------------------------------

`nextPYP <https://nextpyp.app/>`_ is a package for single-particle cryo-EM/ET image analysis developed and maintained by the `Bartesaghi Lab <http://cryoem.cs.duke.edu>`_.

By combining established tools in the field with `methods developed in-house <https://cryoem.cs.duke.edu/research/methods/>`_, ``nextPYP`` produces state-of-the-art results while being user-friendly and scalable to large datasets.

Main features
-------------
- **Ease-of-use**: user-friendly, fully-featured web-based GUI with intuitive block-based architecture
- **End-to-end**: convert raw cryo-EM/ET data into high-resolution structures using a single application
- **Particle picking suite**: cellular pattern mining and suite of particle picking tools in 2D and 3D
- **High-resolution**: advanced 3D refinement and classification tools achieve state-of-the-art results
- **Scalability**: small storage footprint and distributed computing allows analysis of large datasets
- **On-the-fly processing**: real-time analysis of micrographs and tilt-series during data acquisition
- **Portability and compatibility**: easy to install and configure, interoperable with external packages
