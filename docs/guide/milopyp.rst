MiLoPYP - Pattern mining
========================

The ``MiLoPYP`` workflow consists of a pattern mining and a refinement stage, each implemented using two blocks:

#. Pattern minning: :badge:`MiLoPYP (train),badge-primary` and :badge:`MiLoPYP (eval),badge-primary` blocks 
#. Refinement: :badge:`Particle-Picking (train),badge-primary` and :badge:`Particle-Picking (eval),badge-primary` blocks

Step 0: Pre-requisites
----------------------

Visualization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To analyze the results of ``MiLoPYP`` interactively, you need to install `Phoenix-Arize <https://docs.arize.com/phoenix>`_ in your *local* machine

For macOS, for example, follow these steps:

#. Download and install miniconda following `these <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html>`_ instructions

#. Activate the miniconda installation, create a new conda environment and install Phoenix:
  
.. code-block:: bash

    source ${INSTALLATION_PATH}/miniconda3/bin/activate
    conda create -n "phoenix" python=3.8 -y
    conda activate phoenix
    conda install -c conda-forge arize-phoenix==0.0.28 pandas -y

Data pre-processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since ``MiLoPYP`` operates on reconstructured tomograms, you first need to pre-process your tilt-series using the :badge:`Pre-processing,badge-primary` block

Step 1: Pattern mining (training)
---------------------------------

To train the mining/exploration module:

#. Click on :guilabel:`Tomograms` (output of the :badge:`Pre-processing,badge-secondary` block) and select :badge:`MiLoPYP (train),badge-primary`

#. Set the training parameters as needed

#. (optional) If you want to train MiLoPYP on a subset of tomograms, create a :doc:`Filter<filters>` in the :badge:`Pre-processing,badge-secondary` block and select its name from the **Filter tomograms** dropdown menu

#. Click :badge:`Save,badge-primary`, :badge:`Run,badge-primary`, and :badge:`Start Run for 1 block,badge-primary`

#. Navigate to the :badge:`MiLoPYP (train),badge-primary` block to monitor the training metrics

Step 2: Pattern mining (evaluation)
-----------------------------------

The trained model can now be evaluated to visualize the results:

#. Click on :guilabel:`MiLoPYP model` (output of the :badge:`MiLoPYP (train),badge-secondary` block) and select :badge:`MiLoPYP (eval),badge-primary`

#. Select the trained model from the block upstream (``*.pth``), for example, ``model_last_contrastive.pth``

#. Click :badge:`Save,badge-primary`, :badge:`Run,badge-primary`, and :badge:`Start Run for 1 block,badge-primary`

#. Navigate to the :badge:`MiLoPYP (eval),badge-primary` block to visualize the embedding and the cluster labels

Step 3: Target selection
------------------------

There are two ways to select paticles for training the refinement module:

Option A: Manual cluster selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the simplest option and does not require running any external tools, it only requires specifying a list of cluster numbers as displayed in the **Class Labels** panel

Option B: Interactive target selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This option requires access to Phoenix to interactively select particles:

* Navigate to the :badge:`MiLoPYP (eval),badge-primary` block and download the file ***_milo.tbz**

* Open a terminal in your local machine, decompress the ***_milo.tbz** file, and run Phoenix:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd $WORK_DIRECTORY
    tar xvfz *_milo.tbz
    conda activate phoenix
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextpyp/cet_pick/main/cet_pick/phoenix_visualization.py -o phoenix_visualization.py
    python phoenix_visualization.py --input interactive_info_parquet.gzip

If everything went well, you should see an output like this:

.. code-block:: bash

        name           coord                                         embeddings  label                             image

    üåç To view the Phoenix app in your browser, visit http://localhost:57534/
    üì∫ To view the Phoenix app in a notebook, run `px.active_session().view()`
    üìñ For more information on how to use Phoenix, check out https://docs.arize.com/phoenix

On another shell (in the same directory), activate the miniconda environment and start the image server: 
  
.. code-block:: bash

    conda activate phoenix
    cd $WORK_DIRECTORY
    python -m http.server 7000

With Phoenix now running:

* Open a browser and visit the url as displayed above, for example: http://localhost:57534/

* Under **Embeddings**, click on ``image_embedding`` to visualize the results. Clicking on a point in the cloud will show the associated image in the bottom panel. You can also select a cluster of points using the left side bar (the correspoinding image gallery will be shown at the bottom of the page)

* Select the points or clusters of interest using the **Select** tool

* Export your selection using the **Export** button and **Download** the results as a ``.parquet`` file

.. note::

    By default, Phoenix's web server runs on port 7000. If that port is not available on your computer, you can specify a custom one using ``phoenix_visualization.py``'s ``--port`` option, for example, ``phoenix_visualization.py --input interactive_info_parquet.gzip --port 8000``. In this case, you will need to specify the same port number when running the http.server, for example, ``python -m http.server 8000``.

* Go back to ``nextPYP`` and navigate to the :badge:`MiLoPYP (eval),badge-primary` block

* Click on the Upload button :fa:`upload, text-primary`, browse to the location of the ``.parquet`` file, and upload the file

.. note::

    Currently, the file will be uploaded and renamed to ``particles.parquet`` on the remote server. If a file with that name already exists, it will be overwriten with the new file

Step 4: Particle refinement (training)
--------------------------------------

Now, we will use the positions selected in the previous step to train the refinement module:

* Click on :guilabel:`MiLoPYP Particles` (output of the :badge:`MiLoPYP (eval),badge-secondary` block) and select :badge:`Particle-Picking (train),badge-primary`

* **Option A**: From the ``Import from MiLoPYP`` menu select "parquet", and specify the location of the ``.parquet`` file you uploaded in the previous step: ``particles.parquet``

* **Option B**: From the ``Import from MiLoPYP`` menu select "class labels" and specify the list of classes you want to use for training (as displayed in the **Class Labels** panel)

* Set parameters for training as needed

* Click :badge:`Save,badge-primary`, :badge:`Run,badge-primary`, and :badge:`Start Run for 1 block,badge-primary`

#. Navigate to the :badge:`Particle-Picking (eval),badge-primary` block to inspect the training metrics

Step 5: Particle refinement (evaluation)
----------------------------------------

The last step is to evaluate the model and obtain the final particle positions:

#. Click on :guilabel:`Particles Model` (output of the :badge:`Particle-Picking (train),badge-secondary` block) and select :badge:`Particle-Picking (eval),badge-primary`

#. Select the location of the ``Trained model (*.pth)`` using the file browser

#. Set parameters for evaluation as needed

#. Click :badge:`Save,badge-primary`, :badge:`Run,badge-primary`, and :badge:`Start Run for 1 block,badge-primary`

#. Navigate to the :badge:`Particle-Picking (eval),badge-primary` block to inspect the particle picking results

The resulting set of particles can be used for 3D refinement using the :badge:`Particle refinement,badge-secondary` block
