   Programs were written by David Mastronarde, James Kremer, Rick
   Gaudette, Sue Held, Quanren Xiong, and John Heumann at the University 
   of Colorado, some based on work and libraries from the MRC.  We thank David
   Agard and Hans Chen for the original MRC source code, Wah Chiu for a Unix
   version of low-level MRC file routines used in the FORTRAN parts, and Chuck
   Robertson for much work on the port to Linux.

   The program nad_eed_3d by Achilleas Frangakis and Reiner Hegerl is
   copyright Max-Planck-Institut for Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany.

   The LSQR routine by Michael Saunders is used in some programs.  IMOD uses a
   C version of LSQR and some BLAS routines from the BCLS package of Michael
   Friedlander, which are covered by the Lesser GPL (see LGPL.txt).

   IMOD uses a subset of the LAPACK routines developed at Univ. of Tennessee,
   Univ. of California Berkeley, NAG Ltd., Courant Institute, Argonne National
   Lab, and Rice University.  They are copyrighted by the University of
   Tennessee and covered by a BSD-style license (see LAPACK.txt).  IMOD also
   uses a subset of the BLAS routines, developed by: Jack Dongarra, Argonne
   National Lab; Jeremy Du Croz, NAG Ltd.; Iain Duff, AERE Harwell; Richard
   Hanson, Sandia National Labs; and Sven Hammarling, NAG Ltd.

   The program imodwincpu was adapted from code obtained from
   www.codeproject.com and written by Dudi Abramov.  It is excluded from the
   GPL license and is covered exclusively by the Code Project Open License (see
   CPOL.html). 

   Routines for computing some statistical functions were adapted from
   S. J. Zhang and J. M. Jin, Computation of Special Functions. New York: John
   Wiley & Sons, 1996 and are copyrighted by the authors and publisher.

   Andrew Noske (originally at the University of Queensland, Australia, then at
   the University of California, San Diego) contributed the beadhelper,
   drawingtools, interpolator, namewizard, and stereology plugins.  See the help
   displayed by those plugins for acknowledgements of funding for his work.

   Jane Ding at California Institute of Technology contributed the Grab with Note
   plugin.

   The isosurface display in 3dmod uses contouring and surface smoothing
   modules from Chimera, developed at the Resource for Biocomputing,
   Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California, San
   Francisco, supported by NIH/NCRR grant P41-RR01081.

   RAPTOR was developed by Fernando Amat, Farshid Moussavi, and Mark Horowitz
   at Stanford University and is copyrighted by them.  It is covered by the
   license in RAPTORlicense.txt.  It uses three libraries, parts of which are
   included in the IMOD source code distribution:
   OpenCV (http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/), 
   covered by the license in OpenCV.txt, 
   SuiteSparse (http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse/), 
   covered by the licenses in CSparse.txt and LGPL.txt, and 
   Stair Vision Library (http://sourceforge.net/projects/stairvision/), 
   covered by the license in StairVision.txt.

   The warping library uses modules from Pavel Sakov's 'nn' package, which are
   copyrighted by Sakov and CSIRO, and covered by the license in nn.txt.  The
   library also uses code from Ken Clarkson's 'hull' program, which is
   copyrighted by AT&T and covered by the license in hull.txt.

   Routines for solving 3x3 eigenvectors are copyrighted by Joachim Kopp and
   covered by the LGPL license.

   The ctffind library was adapted from the ctffind program of Alexis Rohou and
   Nikolaus Grigorieff, which is Copyright (c) 2018, Howard Hughes Medical
   Institute, and is covered by the Janelia Research Campus Software License
   1.2.

   Mauro Maiorca, at the Biochemistry & Molecular Biology Department, Bio21
   Institute, University of Melbourne, Australia, contributed the preNAD and
   preNID programs.  His work was supported by funding from the Australian
   Research Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council.  preNAD
   and preNID use recursive line filter routines from Gregoire Malandain, covered
   by version 3 of the GPL (see GPL-3.0.txt).

   IMOD uses TIFF libraries which are Copyright (c) 1988-1997 Sam Leffler
   and Copyright (c) 1991-1997 Silicon Graphics, Inc. (see TIFF.txt).

   Because IMOD uses the libjpeg library, this software is based in part on the
   work of the Independent JPEG Group.  IMOD also uses the zlib library, which is
   Copyright 1995-2010 by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler.

   IMOD may use FFTW libraries which are Copyright (c) 1997--1999 Massachusetts
   Institute of Technology, written by Matteo Frigo and Steven G. Johnson, and
   covered by version 2 of the GPL.

   IMOD uses HDF5 libraries which are Copyright 1998-2006 by the Board of
   Trustees of the University of Illinois and Copyright 2006-2014 by The HDF
   Group and covered by the license in HDF5.txt.

   The module gcvspl.c is based on an f2c translation of gcvspl.f, which was
   obtained from http://www.netlib.org.  gcvspl.f was written by H.J. Woltring
   based on routines in Lyche et al. (1983) and other sources as documented in
   gcvspl.c.

   IMOD includes a copy of the Mini-XML library which is Copyright 2003-2016 by
   Michael R. Sweet and is covered by the modified Library GPL in Mini-XML.txt

   This work is supported by NIH/NIGMS grant GM125074 to David Mastronarde.
